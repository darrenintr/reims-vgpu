//! Child FIFO record layouts, and the two child commands decoded here.
//!
//! This module holds the parts of the FIFO contract the live drain path reads:
//! the resource-list / invalidate / synchronize record layout, the
//! display-descriptor timing entries, and the `EXEC_INDIRECT2` header offsets.
//!
//! The **opcodes** those records belong to are not here. `reims_vgpu::model::regs`
//! holds one table for the whole device — root and child together — and this
//! module used to restate five of its child entries, four of them byte-identical
//! declarations that nothing imported while the drain's dispatch matched on
//! `regs`. A second table of the same numbers cannot be kept honest by anything
//! in the toolchain: a correction to an opcode the RE got wrong reaches whichever
//! copy its author was reading, and the other one keeps compiling.
//!
//! Packet framing itself — reading a ring, walking headers and stamps, writing
//! back head — is the device model's: it runs against live guest memory and
//! reports each failure as a fault. Nothing here touches memory it was not
//! handed.
