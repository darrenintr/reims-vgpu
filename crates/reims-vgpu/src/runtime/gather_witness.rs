//! Which sampled windows the engine may bind without reading a byte of guest RAM.
//!
//! The three zero-copy sampled producers ([`super::draw::vulkan`]'s
//! linear, mapper-ref-texture and ref-texture rails) hand the engine a
//! [`crate::backend::vulkan::engine::SampledSource::GuestRuns`], and the engine's
//! only byte-moving arm gathers the whole window out of guest RAM into a staging
//! buffer. That arm had no content cache — measured on a driven x86/PCI boot at
//! 360 gathers and **842.4 MB per second**, both figures repeating to the digit
//! across eight consecutive windows, which is the shape of the same unchanged
//! content being re-read every frame rather than of a working set that moves.
//!
//! This module is the cache's witness: it answers "nothing has written these
//! pages since the gather that filled the retained image", and issues a
//! [`GatheredIdentity`] the engine binds on with no compare at all. A *false*
//! answer serves stale pixels, which is a wrong frame that then persists — the
//! failure mode that turned the screen black once already.
//!
//! # The witness takes two halves
//!
//! Neither half alone is sound, because they cover disjoint writers:
//!
//! - the **generation** ([`crate::runtime::host::HostOps::guest_write_gen`], the
//!   hypervisor dirty bitmap) witnesses guest CPU stores, and is defined not to
//!   see writes this device makes;
//! - the **page-exact host-write record**
//!   ([`crate::runtime::host_writes::HostWrites`]) witnesses this device's own
//!   writes into exactly these pages.
//!
//! Both quiet is [`GatherVerdict::Vouched`]: the generation the entry already
//! holds survives, and the gather is skipped. Anything else spends a fresh
//! generation, and the engine's `(key, generation)` lookup misses, so the bytes
//! are read.
//!
//! **A spent generation makes the next lookup miss by construction, and that is
//! the witness working rather than a cache failing.** [`note_gather`] hands both
//! facts back together in a [`GatherOutcome`] for exactly this reason: the
//! identity is what the engine binds and retains on, and the [`GatherVouch`]
//! beside it is whether that identity could ever have named a retained image.
//! An engine that has only the identity cannot tell a compulsory miss from a
//! lost one — it once tried, by asking whether the identity was present at all,
//! and that question has one answer. Every window this witness is asked about
//! gets an entry, so it names every one of them.
//!
//! Verdicts, through [`crate::runtime::drain::note_store_route`]:
//!
//! | route | meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | `gw_vouched` / `gw_vouched_kb` | both halves quiet — the gather is skipped |
//! | `gw_refused_guest_store` | the hypervisor saw a guest store into the pages |
//! | `gw_refused_host_write` | this device wrote pages of this window |
//! | `gw_unarmed` | no token, or a generation not yet readable — no answer |
//! | `gw_rearm` | the window's page set changed, so nothing to compare against |
//! | `gw_audit_seed` | first fold of this window — expected, and not the alarm |
//! | `gw_audit_restart` | an armed window was refused `AUDIT_REBASELINE_LIMIT` times running, so no vouch was ever claimed to check |
//! | `gw_audit_rebaseline` | armed and refused: the baseline is retaken from the bytes the gather reads anyway |
//! | `gw_audit_ok` | folded under a live baseline and the bytes agreed |
//! | `gw_audit_unsound` | folded under a live baseline and the bytes had moved |
//!
//! # The half that refuses is `gw_refused_host_write`, by 368 to 1
//!
//! A driven x86/PCI Safari drag, quiesced, 166 census windows:
//!
//! ```text
//! gw_vouched             6050
//! gw_refused_host_write  5156
//! gw_refused_guest_store   14
//! gw_unarmed              212
//! gw_rearm                128
//! gw_audit_unsound          0
//! ```
//!
//! The guest hardly writes the windows it samples; something on this device's
//! side is what refuses them, and each refusal costs the next bind a full
//! re-gather — 68 % of that rail's misses on the same boot, against 32 % that
//! were a retained image the cache had dropped. So the cache is not the lever.
//!
//! That reading used to end "`gw_audit_unsound` at 0 says the witness stayed
//! sound throughout." **It says no such thing**, and the next section is why.
//!
//! # The audit could never once compare, and that zero was not a measurement
//!
//! [`ContentAudit`] is the alarm for a writer that escapes both halves. To
//! reach a comparison it needs a fold taken under a vouch and still valid at
//! the next stride bind — and `fold_valid` is dropped by **any single refused
//! bind**, correctly, because a refusal means the bytes were free to move. So
//! a comparison needs [`AUDIT_STRIDE`] *consecutive* vouched binds of one
//! window.
//!
//! At the refusal rates every driven boot of this device measures — of the
//! order of 4 700 refusals against 7 300 vouches — a run of 64 is a coincidence
//! this workload does not produce. Three consecutive driven boots read
//! `gw_audit_ok` **0** against `gw_audit_seed` 163-175: every audit bind was a
//! first fold and the fold was never once checked against a previous one.
//!
//! `gw_audit_unsound` was therefore 0 because the comparison never ran, not
//! because it ran and agreed. A real escaping writer went unnoticed behind that
//! zero on this branch — the GPU-direct GVA Store wrote guest pages without
//! recording them, and the audit was structurally incapable of noticing.
//!
//! # A third reason for a zero: the rail did not run at all
//!
//! Both readings above are of a host where the sampled cache was *doing work*
//! and the question was whether the audit could check it. There is a third
//! shape, and it reads identically to the other two in the census, so check for
//! it first.
//!
//! A driven macos-13 boot on a discrete NVIDIA host with
//! `host_pointer_import=supported`, 45 s sustained animation, at
//! `REIMS_VGPU_GATHER_AUDIT_ALL=on`:
//!
//! ```text
//! sampled_guest_imports     88166
//! sampled_gather_unvouched  88166
//! sampled_gathers               0
//! sampled_gather_bytes          0
//! gw_vouched                    0
//! gw_audit_seed / _ok / _unsound   0 / 0 / 0
//! ```
//!
//! Every sampled bind was served by the host-pointer import, so the gather rail
//! this witness exists to elide never ran, so nothing was ever vouched, so the
//! audit had nothing to seed from — three zeros in a row with a single cause.
//! **`gw_vouched` is the field that distinguishes this case**, and it is the one
//! to read before either `gw_audit_ok` or `gw_audit_unsound` means anything: a
//! zero there says no bind on the boot depended on this witness, which is a
//! stronger statement than the audit could ever make and a different one.
//!
//! It is also the shape to expect wherever the import serves every bind, so do
//! not go looking for a defect in this module because a capable host's sweep
//! came back empty. The rail that needs the witness is the one a host without
//! `VK_EXT_external_memory_host` takes, which is why a soundness sweep of this
//! alarm belongs on that arm — see `REIMS_VGPU_GUEST_IMPORT=off`.
//!
//! # On the Intel iGPU it *was* comparing, and its zero is a real reading
//!
//! The paragraphs above are a measurement of a host with a ~40 % refusal rate.
//! This one is not. A four-rail sweep on the Arrow Lake iGPU sums to:
//!
//! ```text
//!            gw_audit_ok  gw_audit_seed  gw_audit_restart  gw_audit_unsound   refusals/vouches
//! macos-13           115             27                24                 0        838 / 13 331
//! macos-11             7              1                 1                 0         22 /    756
//! ```
//!
//! Six per cent refusals, not forty, so runs of `AUDIT_STRIDE` consecutive
//! vouched binds are ordinary here and the comparison was reachable all along.
//! **122 comparisons and zero disagreements is a real soundness reading for the
//! zero-copy sampled cache on this host** — the first one this alarm has
//! produced.
//!
//! So the two-phase arm is not resurrecting a dead alarm here; it makes the
//! alarm's reachability independent of the refusal rate, which is what the
//! 40 %-refusal host needed and what any future workload could need. Read a
//! `gw_audit_unsound` zero as evidence only when `gw_audit_ok` beside it is
//! large — that pairing is the whole point and it is why both are counted.
//!
//! It is not free: the arm folds twice per stride (once to take the baseline,
//! once to check it) where the old design folded once, so `gw_audit_kb` roughly
//! doubles — on the macos-13 sweep from 177 MB against a 14.6 GB rail, about
//! 1.2 %, to about 2.4 %.
//!
//! **The repair is done.** The audit used to take its baseline and compare on
//! the same stride bind, which is what made a comparison need `AUDIT_STRIDE`
//! consecutive vouches. It is two phases now: the stride bind *arms* the window
//! with a baseline, and the check happens on the **next vouched bind** — because
//! that is the atomic form of the claim under test, "a vouched bind means these
//! bytes did not move". A refusal while armed re-folds from the bytes the gather
//! is about to read (`gw_audit_rebaseline`) and keeps the arm, bounded by
//! [`AUDIT_REBASELINE_LIMIT`] so a never-vouched window cannot pull the whole
//! rail back through the audit.
//!
//! # A sweep can judge every bind instead of one in sixty-four
//!
//! The 122 comparisons above stand against some fourteen thousand vouches, so a
//! zero there is evidence about 1.6 % of the population. That is the right ratio
//! to ship — the fold is a read of the window, which is the rail this cache
//! exists to remove — but it is the wrong ratio to answer "is this cache sound
//! on this host" with.
//!
//! [`crate::config::GATHER_AUDIT_ALL`] sets [`AuditDensity::EveryBind`], under which
//! every vouched bind is compared against the bind before it: the stride drops to
//! 1 and a completed comparison leaves the window armed, its own fold being the
//! next bind's baseline. It can only turn elisions into re-gathers, never the
//! other way, so it is a narrowing switch in this crate's sense — one that
//! narrows by doing more work. Run a rail sweep under it and `gw_audit_unsound`
//! becomes a verdict on the whole boot rather than a sample of it. Never quote a
//! timing from such a boot.
//!
//! So `gw_audit_restart` no longer means "structurally unable to compare"; it
//! means one armed window was refused eight times running. The reading to take
//! now is `gw_audit_ok` against `gw_audit_seed`: every arm resolves, so
//! `seed ≈ ok + unsound + restart`, and an `ok` that stays 0 while seeds climb
//! would mean the alarm is dead again.
//!
//! # It was the ring, not the writes: `gw_hw_aged` 4275 against `gw_hw_overlap` 5
//!
//! The split below was measured on the next driven boot and the attribution
//! above is **wrong**:
//!
//! ```text
//! gw_hw_quiet          5706
//! gw_hw_aged           4275     (gw_refused_host_write 4204)
//! gw_hw_overlap           5
//! gw_hw_unnamed           0
//! gw_hw_unresolvable      0
//! ```
//!
//! Five binds in 9986 had a recorded write that actually covers the window.
//! Every other refusal is
//! [`crate::runtime::host_writes::HostWrites`]'s ring having dropped the writes
//! the reader is asking about, so it cannot say nothing touched them. This
//! device is *not* writing the windows it samples; it is failing to remember
//! that it did not. 43 % of every witness ask on that boot was refused for that
//! one reason, and each refusal costs a full re-gather.
//!
//! `RING`'s own doc sized it from "~28 host writes a second against ~330 gathers
//! a second, so the usual answer is zero entries to scan". That held for the
//! workload it was measured on and does not hold under compositing. Band the
//! requested reach before choosing a new size — the number wanted is how far
//! back a reader asks, and nothing has measured it yet.
//!
//! **`gw_refused_host_write` is not "this device wrote these pages".**
//! [`crate::runtime::host_writes::HostWrites::wrote_any_since`] answers "written"
//! for four different reasons and only one of them is a write that landed in the
//! window: the other three are its fail-closed rule — a writer that named no
//! pages, a ring too short to still hold the writes being asked about, and a
//! mapping-named write whose page list has since moved. Three of those are
//! bookkeeping this device could fix without changing what it writes at all.
//! The `gw_hw_*` routes below split them, and until a boot reads them the 5156
//! is an upper bound on real overlap rather than a measurement of it:
//!
//! | route | meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | `gw_hw_quiet` | nothing recorded touched the window — the vouchable case |
//! | `gw_hw_overlap` | a recorded write names one of these pages; the bytes moved |
//! | `gw_hw_unnamed` | a writer could not say where it landed, so all readers assume it |
//! | `gw_hw_aged` | the ring no longer holds the writes this reader asks about |
//! | `gw_hw_unresolvable` | a mapping-named write whose page list cannot be rebuilt |
//!
//! Both halves stay load-bearing and neither may be weakened to raise the vouch
//! rate. Whatever the split says, the repair is to make the record *sharper* —
//! a writer naming its pages rules itself out of windows it never touched —
//! never to let an undecidable read as quiet.
//!
//! # A device-wide `gw_refused_guest_store` is the hypervisor rail, not the guest
//!
//! This counter reads in the low hundreds over a whole driven boot. A boot where
//! it reads in the tens of thousands has not met a guest that started writing its
//! surfaces; it has met a witness that cannot say otherwise, and the difference is
//! worth recognising because the second one latches and the first does not.
//!
//! The shape to look for is a **step**: the per-second rate jumping two orders of
//! magnitude inside one second, across every mapping at once, and never coming
//! back. Per-surface causes cannot do that — only state the whole device shares
//! can, and on this rail that state lives in `reims_vgpu_dirty_harvest`
//! (`hw/display/reims-vgpu-dirty.c`), which reads any tracked page it cannot
//! resolve to a recorded guest-RAM range as written. One such bug is fixed and
//! documented there: the harvest cut its window with a walk that swallowed every
//! page above the first non-RAM byte, and nothing unwound it short of a reboot.
//!
//! It is worth recognising from the other side too, because the same step drives
//! `runtime::draw`'s mapper-ref-texture sampled rung into
//! `t11rung_resident_refused`, whose merge skips every page the witness claims
//! and so leaves a GPU-side composite reading blank. Twelve recorded boots
//! separated on this counter with no overlap — 155-186 clean against
//! 20 122-34 772 degraded — which makes it the gate for that class as well.
//!
//! # An unarmed window gathers on every bind, and the cache was keeping each copy
//!
//! One RX 7600 second with the diagnostic witness off, same-load, 3 608 draws:
//!
//! ```text
//! gw_rail_linear   630  (1 596 037 KB)     gw_hw_quiet     624
//! gw_unarmed       610                     gw_hw_overlap    13
//! gw_rearm          15                     gw_vouched       18
//! gw_refused_*       0                     ~57 distinct windows
//! ```
//!
//! **What that reading establishes by itself.** No bind in it was refused: the
//! 628 gathers are 15 re-pointed windows, 610 binds of a window whose pages had
//! *not* moved since the previous bind, and 3 the cache lost. [`observe`] returns
//! [`GatherVerdict::Unarmed`] only for a window it has already seen with the same
//! pages and span, so those 610 were repeats of identical windows by
//! construction. Neither half of the witness had an objection to them — the
//! hypervisor half had no *answer*, because `guest_write_gen` reads 0 until the
//! shim's harvests have run over a new token, and a gather read nothing it could
//! compare. Which of three things that was is [`UnarmedCause`], and nothing before
//! `gather_storm` could split it.
//!
//! **What the cache did with them.** `sampled_gather_unretained` was 3: the
//! cache lost almost nothing it could have served, so eviction was not what made
//! 628 gathers. It was, however, filling itself with their images — each unarmed
//! gather retained a 2.5 MB image under a fresh generation, 728 byte-cap
//! evictions in the second, and `sampled_free_allocs` 675 against 628 gathers —
//! so the free pool fed none of them. Those images could never be found: a bind that read no
//! generation records 0 as its baseline, the next bind meets `entry.gen == 0`
//! and spends a generation of its own, and a generation only survives a bind
//! through [`GatherVerdict::Vouched`]. [`GatherVouch::Unreachable`] names that,
//! and [`GatherOutcome::identity`] is `None` for it, so the engine declines to
//! admit the image (`sampled_admit_no_identity`) and recycles it. This is not a
//! relaxation of the witness: no vouch changes and no gather is skipped. It stops
//! the cache holding what cannot be asked for. **How many allocations that
//! returns is not yet measured** — a recycled slot waits on its submission's fence
//! like any other, so inside one long tranche it may return few. Read
//! `sampled_free_allocs` and `alloc_us` against `gw_unnameable` on the next
//! boot before quoting a gain.
//!
//! **What it does not do, and why the rest was left alone.**
//!
//! - *A synchronous baseline.* Reading a generation immediately after
//!   `track_guest_writes` cannot cover the writes made before logging was on,
//!   and `HostOps::track_guest_writes` states that enabling logging is deferred
//!   to a bottom half under the BQL. The shim's arming rule lives in the QEMU
//!   submodule, which this checkout does not carry, so a change there was not
//!   audited and none is made. The Rust-side conclusion stands on its own: until
//!   the shim can say *at which harvest* logging became active, the first
//!   gather after arming is the earliest the baseline can describe.
//! - *Reusing one gathered image inside the arming window.* No half of the
//!   witness can vouch there, and "unarmed means unchanged" is exactly the
//!   inference this module exists to refuse. A content compare is the one other
//!   sound witness in the tree, and it is a CPU read of every byte the gather
//!   would move; `fold_same` on `gather_storm` (under
//!   [`crate::config::GATHER_STORM_FOLD`]) is the ceiling on what it could save,
//!   and until a boot reads it there is no case to argue.
//! - *More cache.* `sampled_gather_unretained` bounds what capacity could buy at
//!   3 gathers of 628.
//!
//! The `gather_storm` lines (see [`crate::runtime::gather_storm`]) are the instrument for
//! what remains: whether the repeats sit inside one drain tranche, how many binds
//! a window takes to read its first generation, whether any host is refusing
//! tokens, and which windows carry the volume.
//!
//! # The content fold is now an audit, not the decision
//!
//! A full fold over the window is what *established* the rule above: crossed
//! against the two halves it produced the cell "vouched, and the bytes moved
//! anyway", which condemned three candidate rules in turn before the surviving
//! one read zero across four driven boots.
//!
//! Running it on every bind would defeat the cache it licensed — a skipped
//! gather that still reads every byte to fold them has moved the cost, not
//! removed it. So the fold runs once per
//! [`crate::runtime::gather_witness::AUDIT_STRIDE`] binds of a window and
//! its verdict is a standing alarm rather than an input:
//!
//! | route | meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | `gw_audit_ok` | folded under a vouch, and the bytes were where it said |
//! | `gw_audit_unsound` | **folded under a vouch, and the bytes had moved** |
//! | `gw_audit_seed` | folded with no trustworthy predecessor to compare against |
//! | `gw_audit_kb` | bytes the audit read — the whole remaining cost of the fold |
//!
//! `gw_audit_unsound` is the one that matters, and it is not only counted: it
//! fails through the always-on log with the window that broke, and drops the
//! vouched generation so the next bind re-gathers. Both holes found while
//! building this witness — a per-mapping rule whose pages aliased, and a writer
//! outside the host-write record — fired tens to hundreds of times per boot, so
//! sampling costs the alarm latency and not its reach.
