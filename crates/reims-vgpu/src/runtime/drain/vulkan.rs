//! The Vulkan rail's completion-stamp publication.
//!
//! This rail can attach the stamp word to the GPU submission the guest work
//! precedes, so the drain worker hands the word to a completion thread instead
//! of blocking on that work. Everything here exists to decide whether that is
//! available for one stamp, and to fall back honestly when it is not.
//!
//! Reached only through [`crate::backend::Backend::order_completion_stamp`]; the
//! drain never names this rail.
