//! **A slug is the only thing a failure-channel reader has.**
//!
//! An observation carries the slug and its payload and nothing that says which
//! module minted it, so two refusals in different modules sharing one slug
//! make every report of either ambiguous — and the reader who investigates
//! goes to the wrong owner. Every module already checks that its own slugs are
//! distinct from each other, which is the check a module can make alone and is
//! not the check that matters: a collision is a fact about all the sources at
//! once, produced by two modules written months apart drawing on the same
//! small vocabulary.
//!
//! The second law is the shape a collision arrives in. A reason is namespaced
//! by its owner and a classification is a bare word, so a reason that lost its
//! prefix is one word in a space of three hundred and the next module to want
//! that word takes it.
